<h3>IP Man (All Series) </h3>
<p>This series is a must watch for all the action head. It tells history, romance and beautifully choreographed fighting scene.</p>
<h3>Flash Point</h3>
<p>Another classic by Donnie Yen. Hair-raising fighting scene will leave you breathless and I lost count how many times I rewatched the fight in the downtown wet market.</p>
<h3>Police Story (All Series)</h3>
<p>It would be a crime to not mentioned Jacky Chan's masterpiece in this list. Need no introduction (mic drop).</p>
